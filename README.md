# CGPA-CALCULATOR
A Student grade calculator is used for taking the grades input for all subjects and then calculating the percentage based upon the marks of the students. This calculator returns a fairly reliable indicator of student results.

The simple formula for calculating grades is:

Percentage = Marks ScoredTotal Marks×100
We are going to take the inputs using HTML, once the inputs are entered we will call the JS function to calculate the average percentage of these numbers and will return the same to the user.

Steps for creating a calculator −

We will be taking inputs from the user using the input tag.

Once the inputs are taken, we will pass these inputs to the calculate function in JS.

The calculate function will basically aggregate the result for this and return the result

On getting the result, the HTML will display the result to the user.
